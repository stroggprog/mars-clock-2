# Part Three Instructions

Rule #1: Always know where you are:

```
cd ~/
```

Clone the clock repository and run the menu. There are no specific releases, as the clock uses a rolling-release paradigm.

```
git clone https://github.com/stroggprog/mars-clock-2
cd mars-clock-2
sudo ./menu
```

**WARNING: Under no circumstances edit, create or delete files in the repository as it may block the menu system from fetching updates**

Read [Menu Instructions](MENU.md)
